                    space
                    and desire for one. What size and type of vanity you can fit into your particular bathroom. How to
                    work
                    around existing window placement to maximize air flow and natural light. What kind of door works
                    best
                    for privacy and ease of use, or, in the case of a primary suite, whether to install a door at all.

                <h3>BED ROOM</h3>
                <p class="text-center lead">There's no denying that a bedroom is one of the most important rooms in your
                    home. Considering a schedule full of work and family commitments, having a cozy place to unwind and recharge is
                    non-negotiable. That's why finding inspiration in bedroom decorating ideas is crucial.
                    The perfect bedroom relies on simple decorating tricks, from inviting paint colors and stylish
                    headboards to statement lighting and window treatments. And if you're up for putting a few interior
                    design trends to the test, there's room for that too. You can consider weaving in elements like
                    graphic wallpaper or non-traditional pieces of furniture (try using a console table as a nightstand, for
                    instance) to infuse your space with personality.</p>
