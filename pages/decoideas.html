                    <h4>1. Enhance a Backyard View</h4>
                    <p>Working with landscape architect Lila Fendrick, designer Nestor Santa Cruz chose a wall of steel
                        and
                        glass windows and doors for this formal pool house living room that leads to the backyard.
                        Though the glass decor,
                        from the pendant light to the coffee table and doors, leaves a decidedly sleek impression, the
                        plush rug
                        and ethereal curtains make it extra cozy, too.</p>

                    <h4>2. Work Around Restrictions</h4>
                    <p>When designer Celerie Kemble moved into this New York City apartment, there was only one thing
                        that prevented
                        it from being the perfect fit: The building had a no wallpaper rule. To work around that
                        obstacle, she
                        applied a light shade of pink paint in a plaster-like finish that channels the texture of
                        wallpaper.</p>

                    <h4>3. Mix Clean Lines With Casual Materials</h4>
                    <p>In the living room of designer Devin Kirk, a light shade of blue-gray along with clean-lined
                        furniture makes
                        for a polished backdrop while the woven chairs, light wood side table, and tree stump coffee
                        table
                        ensure a laidback atmosphere. It's the perfect balance of approachable and formal.</p>

                    <h4>4. Incorporate Fun Trees and Plants</h4>
                    <p>Invite some nods to nature into your living room with quirky indoor plants and trees. Designer
                        Elizabeth
                        Cooper placed a lush citrus tree in the corner for an extra pop of life and color and then
                        staggered
                        topiaries on the windowsill.</p>

                    <h4>5. Create Zones With Area Rugs</h4>

            <div class="col-xxl-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 border">
                <h3 class="p-2">KITCHEN</h3>
                <h4>1. Make It Feel Extra Homey </h4>
                <p>Just because your kitchen doesn't get a ton of natural light doesn't mean it can't have a sunny
                    disposition. The cheerful yellow wallpaper in Shavonda Gardner's kitchen proves it. Featuring
                    unlacquered copper pots, soapstone counters that quickly patina, and a simple central dining table
                    instead of a kitchen island, the kitchen's lived-in atmosphere instantly makes anyone who enters
                    feel
                    right at home.</p>

                <h4>2. Place Extra Chairs in Low-Traffic Corners</h4>
                <p>If the space is small, play around with fun wallpaper. Something with a little sheen will make the
                    room
                    gleam... even if you haven't gotten to the dishes in, uh, a while. Sheila Bridges also opted for a
                    complementary fabric on these accent chairs to enhance the blues throughout and tucked them in a
                    low-traffic corner for convenience.</p>

                <h4>3. Use Statement Fabric for Seating</h4>
                <p>Designer Kristin Fine gave her classic farmhouse a modern twist with glossy zellige tiles on the
                    walls,
                    Calacatta marble from ABC Stone on the counters, and vintage opaline pendants, black flush mounts,
                    and
                    vintage stools reupholstered in a mossy Pierre Frey fabric. The exposed beams maintain the
                    countryside
                    roots of the home and the pale green tones honor the forest views outside.</p>

                <h4>4. Start With One Accent Piece</h4>
                <p>This kitchen was designed around the homeowners's inherited ceramic collection. She told designer
                    Andy
                    Beers of Ore Studios that she wanted the blue midcentury serve ware and tableware to anchor the
                    entire
                    space, so they mixed in open cubbies and added splashes of red for a vibrant yet straightforward
                    color
                    palette.</p>

                <h4>5. Remodel Cabinet Uppers to Optimize Storage</h4>
                <p>If your kitchen wall is lined with windows, consider adding a pretty treatment that doesn't totally
                    block
                    the light, like cafe curtains, and make sure your lower cabinets can take care of most of the
                    storage
                    needs. This way, you can forgo lining the wall with uppers. Instead, install one strategic column.

                    <h3>DINING ROOM</h3>
                </div>

                <div class="text-end">
                    <h4>1. Balance Warmth With Formality</h4>
                    <p>A matching table and chair set creates cohesion in this eclectic dining nook designed by Ariene
                        Bethea.
                        Bolster pillows and custom throws make the corner nook extra cozy and multi-purpose. Though it
                        feels
                        tailored, it's still approachable and warm.</p>

                    <h4>2. Separate Zones With Ceiling Wallpaper</h4>
                    <p>A sunny shade of sisal wallpaper connects the open kitchen to the dining room and separates it
                        from the
                        seating area in this great room designed by Halden Interiors.</p>

                    <h4>3. Think Outside the Obvious Layout Options</h4>
                    <p>An offset, extra-large circular table flatters the shape of the window nook without appearing too
                        cramped, as it's not crammed right up against the windows nor smack dab in the middle of the
                        room. While
                        the colors are muted and the materials are understated, the goemtric shapes throughout add tons
                        of
                        intrigue.</p>

                    <h4>4. Enable Indoor/Outdoor Flow</h4>
                    <p>Kingston Lafferty Design created an indoor/outdoor dining room by extending a built-in table on
                        both ends
                        of the wall. They're connected by a large window with accordion glass doors for seamless flow
                        when
                        larger parties are dining and visually by the glossy tiles. Visually, they're a stylish
                        statement and
                        outside, a durable, weatherproof material. Plants also make the two spaces feel like they're in
                        conversation with each other.</p>

                    <h4>5. Customize a Banquette</h4>
                    <p>Custom back cushions that match the seats create both cohesion and comfort in this dining nook
                        designed
                        by Studio Shamshiri. The wooden wall paneling warms up the darker elements and also reflects the
                        more
                        casual chairs across the table.</p>

                <h3>BATH ROOM</h3>

                <!--BATHROOM INFO-->
                <div class="text-start">
                    <h4>1. Open Plan </h4>
                    <p>This bold minimalist open plan double shower and bath from interior designer Cathie Hong of
                        Cathie Hong Interiors has pivoting glass doors that can be left open to maximize light and air
                        flow from
                        the wrap-around windows, or shut to prevent unwanted shower splashes. Double showerheads are
                        discreetly installed on opposite sides of the self-enclosed wash room, keeping the focus on the
                        tub and
                        the view.</p>

                    <h4>2. Double Wall-Mounted Sinks</h4>
                    <p>Not every shared bathroom needs a built-in double vanity. In this child's shared bathroom from JL
                        Design, matching wall-mounted industrial sinks are hung at kid-friendly height to give siblings
                        their
                        own space.</p>

                    <h4>3. Wall Tile</h4>
                    <p>Covering bathroom walls in floor-to-ceiling stone or tiling has become a widespread design
                        trend that is practical from a cleaning perspective and has the visual advantage of drawing the
                        eye upward
                        to make bathrooms feel more spacious.</p>

                    <h4>4. Lighting</h4>
                    <p>Installing good lighting is an important part of any room design, but bathroom lighting can often
                        be harsh and unflattering in the room where you least want it to be. In this bathroom from
                        interior
                        designer Rhianna Jones of Tidal Interiors, LED backlighting adds a glamorous touch to a sleek
                        built-in wall-to-wall shower niche. The ambient light creates a soothing glow for nighttime
                        showers and
                        adds another layer of lighting in a space lacking in natural light. If attempting to add light
                        to a
                        shower, be sure to enlist a professional who can ensure that it's safe and waterproof.</p>

                    <h4>5. Upcycled Vanity</h4>
                    <p>When choosing a bathroom vanity, consider upcycling a vintage or antique wood piece of
                        furniture and adding a sink and waterproof countertop. Interior designer Abbie Naber of A. Naber
                        Design
                        upcycled a midcentury modern buffet into a handsome bathroom vanity with character and plenty of
                        storage.</p>

                        small bedroom into a dreamy coastal retreat by building a cozy captain's bed that they then
                        surrounded
                        with vintage indigo textiles and topped with an indigo-inspired wallpaper.</p>

                    <h4>2. Small Space Storage</h4>
                    <p>You would never guess that this bright and airy all white bedroom measures only 170 square
                        feet!
                        Painting
                        the planked ceiling, shiplapped walls, and trim all the same crisp, clean white was key to
                        achieving
                        this deceivingly spacious look.</p>

                    <h4>3. Statement Headboard</h4>
                    <p>In her master bedroom, style blogger and author Liz Marie Galvan (@lizmariegalvan) chose a
                        mantel-inspired headboard to add architectural interest against the plain white walls. A
                        chunky
                        cable-knit throw atop layers of subtle striped bedding provides softness.</p>

                    <h4>4. Mixing Patterns</h4>
                    <p>For a bedroom that really pops, like this Texas guest room, start by painting your walls and
                        trim
                        a crisp
                        white. Then bring in graphic patterns through a rug and upholstered headboard. Topping the
                        bed
                        with all
                        white bedding helps the patterns pop even more. Tip: Choose pieces of similar colors to keep
                        the
                        look
                        tailored and sophisticated.</p>

                    <h4>5. Salvaged Headboard</h4>
                    <p>For a unique headboard, stylist Matthew Gleason turned a salvaged door on its side. To keep
                        installation
                        easy, attach the door directly to the wall and pair with a simple platform bed.</p>
